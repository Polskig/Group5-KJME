Lundqvist, Erika

As we were a smaller group consisting of 4 members, much of our programming was done individually (while sitting together and of course helping one another out). As such, I spent much of my time focused on the website/tablet prototype design. A lot of time went into constructing the buttons, tables and divs, beginning primarily with html and css, as if it isn’t pretty, I will remain distracted while writing the script. Until this project I had not managed to figure out how to make anything run cross-device. Knowing this I allowed myself to wait until after the first round of user-testing to make sure that we would be continuing with this prototype. 

The first round in user-testing was more of a “if this were presented to you, what would you expect it to do”? That is, it did rather little at this point. While I had my hypotheses, a few more ideas that I had not thought about were presented. 

Most of my code is functions relating to buttons, with quite a few if statements as I ended up with a set of tables and divs that would hide and replace one-another. It may have been a better idea to have worked with individual cells within the table instead of whole tables, leaving me with much cleaner code. Quite a few times, I had to turn to pen and paper to write down and just barely sketch things out in order to understand how the code would work.  

I did not complete everything that I wanted to do as it was too time consuming and wouldn’t help much in the second round of user-testing – which was the ability to toggle through buildings. The idea is that you can chose a building and the time buttons will highlight where there is a room available, or you could choose a time that will highlight where a building is available. I was only able to include the toggle between times in the second version. From my understanding of javascript, including a toggle between both times and buildings would result in several sets of button menus, which felt like more work than necessary to successfully user-test. That being said, this was of course found to be desired when user testing the second time.

Then came the dreaded web-sockets. I spent a lot of time on this. I looked at different examples that I had collected throughout the course from different classmates and different assignments, tried to simplify them, compare them, and understand them. I also looked at my own failed attempts from the past to see what was done so differently, and why they didn’t work.

I came to a point where I really thought that I understood it (and in retrospect, I mostly did), but I still could not get it to work. Of course, the only thing separating me from this point and a working version was a good nights’ sleep. Ultimately, I “restarted”, again, using the websocket skeleton, carefully putting in my code into each file, reloading the page after every change to make sure it still worked. I eventually wound up having a form submit button triggering the exchange – and an inability to move that form without breaking it. After so many attempts the issue was that I had a function that replaced a div that (I think) cancelled the message send. All I had to do was change the function to hide and show the div, instead of replace it. I may have had it right for awhile, but this was blocking its’ success.
