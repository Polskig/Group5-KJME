# Group5-KJME
# Vibrations
Here are different kind of vibrations that was used to learn different pattern and different ways to use the vibration

The code unfortunately only works on android and best on chrome 

They were tested with glitch (no links) and you don't need to install or add any npm to make it work it is just download and it should work.

You can try the different codes in glitch and open the same glitch adress on the phone to make so it works
