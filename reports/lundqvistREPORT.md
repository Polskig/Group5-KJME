In the programming portion of the project, I had primarily focused on the room-booking website/tablet prototype design. This prototype went through two rounds of user-testing, although the earlier part of the process, the paper sketching and Marvel prototype did not make it to the user. This was foremost because I wanted to have something that I could really put into the users’ hands – landing with printed pages and a cardboard tablet. However, I did also have web-version that would of course be tested using a computer. 

For the first round, the website was very simple in functionality. For the time being, I was more concerned building a proper HTML frame, decorated with CSS and only using JavaScript to replace DIVs or tables on button clicks – where only a very few buttons were active. For user testing, this prototype was to act more of a clean slate to figure out the users’ expectations of its’ functionality, and if the existing functions make sense. 

For the second round, the website prototype offered much more functionality although it was not fully functional – in that still not all buttons were active and of course it did not register data any further than to meet another devices’ screen. In other words, you can still only pretend to book a room. The user-testing for this version resulted in a different type of feedback as the website did a little more – fewer explanations of ideas were needed as they were implemented. 

While admittedly, my knowledge of JavaScript is rather limited, this experience gave me an opportunity to learn what kind of work, with regard to programming, goes into prototyping. There will always be limitations in what can be incorporated into a prototype – especially considering that even finished products often undergo software updates. This is to say that even with better knowledge of JavaScript, programming can still be a burden in prototyping. 

Programming takes a lot of time, and of course it requires a lot of trial and error. When developing concepts, changes happen often, which only means that more time will have to be dedicated. Even if you know exactly what changes need to be made – having it sketched on paper, an ordered to-do list of what needs to be coded and how – it is still a lot of work writing and implementing the code. Then we ought to acknowledge that the code might not work, or, the idea might not make as much sense as you thought it might. This was certainly experienced. 

Although, having a familiar sense of interactivity (at least in this scenario of a website or app) does result in a different type of insights than with more static prototypes. Having more functionality does encourage conversation from users about the current and possible functionalities, and as it is relatively closer to a finished prototype, about the concept itself. Furthermore, it really does help to test an idea, as having a working version, or even a semi-working version, puts your ideas, and the logic behind it, to test.
