We were the smallest group during this project with only four members. The time was dealt individually during the stages of coding and physical prototyping. But, whenever help was needed, the communication in the group was excellent in a sense that the collaboration between us members was unlimited.

### How it was coding (problems/what was learnt):
In most parts of the project, I used the existing WebSocket skeleton that was provided in one of the earlier courses, to enable a cross-device prototype. For example, in one of my prototypes (Vibration Cross-device V2) I managed to send vibration patterns from my stationary computer, to my mobile device. What I encountered was difficulties in understanding the skeleton fully and knowing which code parts were vital to keep and which were not. In addition, because of the limit put in by the web browser it took some time to figure out how to trigger vibration remotely, as the web browser on a mobile device cancels any JavaScript executed non-human interaction. My way of solving the issues in understanding the code, was to look up parts of the code and in most cases triangulate certain sections to see how the code behaved. I did so, to grasp the functionality of the code for future practises.

### Using programming with prototypes:
Programming with JavaScript can be time consuming. And if one lacks the basics understanding, it can be the very death of the project. Like prototyping with e.g. cardboard-programming shares the same strategic plan in the sense that one is required to have a plan/sketch before actually prototyping. If not, one could easily end up cancelling the prototyping session mid-way because of the fact that it did not turn out to be the way one wanted. To conclude, it is important to know what kind of prototype one is designing.
JavaScript as a tool can be powerful in many ways. Take my Vibration Cross-device V2 for example. Without such power in that particular sense of fidelity would not be possible.

If I compare prototypes made with code and prototypes made with cardboard, itâ€™s possible to see that there are different aspects that is possible to be discovered using them both. With code it is possible to test different vibration patterns that would give different information to the user. On the other hand, using cardboard can help with testing e.g. different sizes, shapes and how it is using it. To conclude, the short comparison using programming helps with testing more advanced prototypes while cardboard helps with testing with how the prototype e.g. should look like.

Finally using programming with prototypes is a good way to test higher fidelity prototypes that could not have been done without programming language. Because of these points mentioned before I have a clearer view of how much programming with JavaScript can help with prototypes.

### For the future:
For the future it would been have good to do more user testing with more patterns of vibrations, so that it would be possible to understand more of how it can be used for not only this project but for others too.
