he majority of the coding time was spent individually, and I spent much of the time coding the vibration. The coding part that to the longest when doing this was to get it cross device and also figure out different patterns to use. It was not easy with coding this code because it was hard to get so that it was possible to control the phone from the computer. But after long time of coding, it was finally possible to do the action that I wanted to be done. During the coding I learnt new ways of how to code and learnt better how important it is to comment the code that is written so that you know what is happening. Also taught me better to use the WebSocket to make cross device prototypes.

The experience I got when running the code was that it worked how I thought it would do. The process when coding was not so easy to get it crossed device, so that I could control from the computer what kind of vibration the phone would do. When we were testing what people thought of the vibration and if they got the right feeling from the vibration for example if the room the person walked beside is free or not. And this would give a vibration pattern when you walked beside the room. We did not go with this to the second round of prototyping because there was not so much of user testing we could use the vibration for.

Doing so the code would be cross device, was the best option so that we could test it with user having the phone in the pocket and we are pressing the buttons on the computer to make it send vibration to the phone. Doing this without programming would be hard to do because of what was tested with the vibration, and that was to see if the vibration patterns would give of the signal that the room was available or unavailable. It was hard for the user to understand what the patterns wanted to give for information because they were too like each other.

Using the programming as a resource for learning different aspect of booking system. This helped to understand and to make it easier so that we could find different aspect to investigate in the booking system. Like when it was used for the vibration to see when it was used how the user would react when exposed to the different vibration patterns. This would be something that would be hard to do only with physical prototyping. But a burden using programming is that it was time consuming. In the sense that you could have made more physical prototypes during the same amount of time, to where you spend to figure out why the codes does not do what you want.

In the end coding this whole thing helped me understand better how coding works, and that you need to have some patient. Because it took a long time for me to figure out why it would not work across device. And the patient run out of times (or more to many times), and this taught me how to over some that a little and focus to find the problem.
