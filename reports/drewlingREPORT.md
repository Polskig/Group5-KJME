#Programming 2 Report

My initial reaction was a genuin concern as to how programming could fit in with the fast-paced environment of prototyping.
Our past experiences with prototyping had proved that it is a good idea to be able to produce prototypes quickly and efficiently 
to be able to test many different ideas and make changes effectively throughout the user testing stages. 
I was not entirely sure about how to find the right 'types' of code to implement into our designs,
without it turning into an unnecessary gimmick and actually contributing to the prototypes in a meaningful way.

Our final project's scenario presented us with some great opportunities to implement programming into our prototypes.
We worked with Uis on both phone and computer, as well as working with web-sockets and APIs.
We did split the workload, due to being a smaller group, but all ended working together on all aspects of the programming at some point.
I worked a lot with AR.js which is an API that focuses on making the use of augmented reality easy accessible.
AR.js was initially hard to use, but I had gained a good level of understanding with it from the previous assignment and felt this was a 
good opportunity to put my experience to the test in a fast-paced prototyping environment.
Our scenario allowed me to explore creating augmented reality overlays with this API to mimmick the QR codes used
by the universities room booking system. What was great was the level of authenticity that was able to be produced. 
It felt like the real deal to users and that is something that helps to gain more realistic and substantial insights during user testing.
Users were able to open the link to the live demos on their own phones and start testing right away.
Something that was interesting is how genuine the responses from users were while testing the prototypes.
They would talk about their concerns and most importantly were able to show me exactly what they meant on their devices.
The prototype created a platform for us and the users to mutally discuss and communicate ideas and feedback,
allowing for a greater amount of depth with our analasys.
Finding the right "type" of programming for our chosen scenario allowed us to make prortypes that were useful
for collaborating as a team and helped to push our prortotypes further in what felt like the 'right' direction
for our users and the scenario.

Throughout the project it felt like we were making progress and increasing our effectiveness with techniques, that we were maybe already familiar with, 
but by no means confident with. Sometimes it did feel like we were slowing ourselves down, or not achieving our goals quickly enough,
due to the amount of time spent and weighing that up against what we actually gained from this time that we spent on a particular aspect of a prototype.
One example of this would be when we were implementing web-sockets. It felt as though too much time spent to trying to figure out how to implement them, 
but once we did implement them we could see the benefit of having the added layer of functionality they provided.
Picking wich elements of programming to use for which prototypes was a challenge and needed careful consideration, 
which was important but not initially realized. This relates to all forms of prototyping and the concept of prototyping itself.
Careful consideration of what to add and what to leave out, in order to produce a prototype that explores the right questions or concerns.
