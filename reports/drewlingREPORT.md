As the smallest group in the class we tried to split up the workload for the programming in this project to try and use our time efficiently. We all worked individually where possible on the programming and came together to solve issues we stumbled across like implementing web-sockets which are used in some of our prototypes. 
The prototypes I spent most of my time on used AR.js and explored the QR code system used in our scenario. The QR codes were a big topic when we researched our scenario and I wanted to expand my skills with the AR.js API further. It also made sense to use AR.js for prototyping because of the knowledge I’ve gained with APIs and this specific API during the last assignment, which allowed me to use it efficiently as a quick prototyping tool.
Most of my time was spent experimenting how to best make users aware of the feedback that was wanted with the QR codes. This time I worked a lot with animations and attributes to create scenes. I have become more proficient with this and I feel like this is something I can take away into other programming projects in the future.
Although I used my most time working with AR.js we also came together to solve other issues. We spent a lot of time trying to implement web-sockets and although my code doesn’t need a web-socket, I feel confident that I could add one when needed now which feels extremely useful and is something I plan on doing more when the time comes. I did at one point add a web-socket to one of my prototypes, but it didn’t add anything into the scenario that was needed and, in the end, just used a lot of time that I could’ve spent in other areas.
The project I feel has pushed my ability in programming a bit further. I have become better in multiple areas and explored and understood areas that I was not comfortable with before. Also, my view on prototyping with programming has changed. Although it was sometimes slow to make something work with code because of the lac of knowledge, I have become quicker at figuring out a solution. More importantly when using programming within a prototype it’s good to figure out the best way to do it early on and prioritise on the right kind of code for the job, to get results quickly and produce prototypes at a good pace. 
Another thing that I’ve realized is to not back away from things I don’t understand when it comes to programming. When we did the API project I absolutely hated the library because it was difficult, and I didn’t understand how to use it. I thought once I’m done with this I will never touch it again. By the end of that project I felt like I had accomplished something, and I was more than willing to work with AR.js again. After using it again for this project I feel like I have gotten so far with it now, which makes me think that I can get to the same level with everything else as well.
